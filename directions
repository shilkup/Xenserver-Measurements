Place the following files in the Physical Machines:
    1) net.sh (ONLY use the file provided by us)
    2) xenstat-1.pl (ONLY use the file provided by us)
    3) vmstat (this application should already be install in the PM)
    4) top (this application should already be install in the PM)
    5) mpstat (this application should already be install in the PM)

Place the following files in the Virtual Machines:
    1) vmstat (this application should already be install in the PM)
    2) top (this application should already be install in the PM)
    
Place the following files in the machince, which you will use to run the parallel-1.0.sh file:
    1) paralleltest-1.0.sh (ONLY use the file provided by us)
    2) refinedata-1.0.sh (ONLY use the file provided by us)
    
How to run:

    bash paralleltest-1.0.sh <number of time you want to run this experiment>
    i.e. bash paralleltest-1.0.sh 5

    NOTE: the instruction to run the refinedata-1.0.sh is placed inside paralleltest-1.0.sh file.
          you can run it manually if any error occurs while running the parallel test.
    Here is how you run refinedata-1.0.sh

        bash refinedata-1.0.sh <number of time you ran the experiment with paralleltest-1.0.sh file> <prefix of the folder>
        i.e. bash refinedata-1.0.sh 5 140709213705
        
        NOTE: folder prefix contains date and time of the folder's creation or the time we executed paralleltest-1.0.sh script
            : this is an example of a folder name: 140709213705testResults0
